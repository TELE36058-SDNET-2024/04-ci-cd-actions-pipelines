To create a GitHub Actions workflow that executes an Ansible playbook designed to ping a list of hosts, follow these steps. This example assumes you have a playbook named ping.yml within your repository, which contains the necessary tasks to ping your hosts.

Step 1: Prepare Your Ansible Playbook
Create an Ansible playbook named ping.yml in your repository with the following content, adjusting the hosts as necessary:

```yaml
---
- name: Ping hosts
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
  - name: Ping
    ansible.builtin.ping:
```

This playbook uses the ansible.builtin.ping module to ping the hosts defined in your inventory.

Step 2: Define Your GitHub Actions Workflow
1. In your repository, navigate to or create the .github/workflows directory.
2. Create a new file named ansible-ping.yml (or another name of your choosing) in this directory.
3. Add the following content to the ansible-ping.yml file:

```yaml
name: Ansible Ping Playbook

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'ansible/**'
      - '.github/workflows/ansible-ping.yml'

jobs:
  ansible-ping:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Setup Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'

    - name: Install Ansible
      run: python -m pip install ansible

    - name: Execute Ping Playbook
      run: ansible-playbook ansible/ping.yml -i ansible/inventory
```


## Key Components:
* runs-on: self-hosted: Specifies that the job should run on a self-hosted runner. Adjust this if your self-hosted runner has specific labels.
* paths: This workflow is triggered on push events, but only when there are changes in the ansible/ directory or the workflow file itself. Adjust the paths as needed.
* checkout: Checks out your repository so the workflow can access it.
* setup-python: Sets up Python, as Ansible is Python-based.
* install ansible: Installs Ansible using pip.
* execute ping playbook: Executes the ping.yml playbook. This step assumes you have an inventory file at ansible/inventory. Adjust the path to your inventory and playbook as necessary.

## Step 3: Add Your Inventory File
Ensure you have an inventory file in your repository, typically at ansible/inventory, defining the hosts you wish to ping. Here's an example inventory:

```
[all]
host1.example.com
host2.example.com
```

## Step 4: Commit Your Changes
Commit the ping.yml playbook, the inventory file, and the ansible-ping.yml GitHub Actions workflow to your repository. Upon pushing these changes, the GitHub Actions workflow will trigger on your self-hosted runner and execute the ping playbook against the hosts defined in your inventory.

## Note on Security:
Be cautious with the scripts and commands you run, especially in a production environment. Ensure your GitHub repository and self-hosted runners are secured to prevent unauthorized access.
