To install a GitHub Actions runner on a Windows machine, you'll need to follow a series of steps to download the runner, configure it, and then start the service. Below is a basic Bash script that outlines these steps. However, since you're on Windows, you'll typically run these commands in PowerShell or Command Prompt. The following is a conceptual Bash script adapted for Windows environments, which you might need to adjust for PowerShell or convert to a .bat or .ps1 script for practical use.

First, ensure you have Git Bash installed if you want to run Bash scripts on Windows, or adapt these commands for PowerShell.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
RUNNER_VERSION="latest"
REPO_URL="https://github.com/your-org/your-repo"
ACCESS_TOKEN="your_github_access_token"
RUNNER_NAME="my-windows-runner"
WORK_DIR="C:/actions-runner"
RUNNER_URL="https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/$RUNNER_VERSION/actions-runner-win-x64-$RUNNER_VERSION.zip"

# Create a directory for the runner
mkdir -p $WORK_DIR
cd $WORK_DIR

# Download the latest GitHub Actions Runner
curl -o actions-runner-win.zip -L $RUNNER_URL

# Extract the installer
unzip actions-runner-win.zip

# Configure the runner
# Note: The token can be obtained from the GitHub repository settings (Actions -> Add runner)
./config.cmd --url $REPO_URL --token $ACCESS_TOKEN --name $RUNNER_NAME --work _work

# Install the runner as a service
./svc.sh install

# Start the service
./svc.sh start
```

## Important Considerations:

REPO_URL: Replace https://github.com/your-org/your-repo with the URL of your GitHub repository.
ACCESS_TOKEN: You need a personal access token with the appropriate permissions or an authentication token provided by GitHub when setting up a new runner through the UI.
RUNNER_VERSION: This script uses the "latest" tag to download the most recent version of the runner. You might want to specify a fixed version for consistency across installations.
Windows Compatibility: This script is written with Bash syntax and uses UNIX commands (mkdir, curl, unzip) that might not be directly compatible with Command Prompt. For execution in Windows, it's recommended to use PowerShell or convert these commands to a .bat or .ps1 script.
GitHub API Changes: The process to download and configure GitHub Runners might change, so it's a good idea to refer to the latest GitHub documentation for the most up-to-date instructions.
This script provides a basic framework. Depending on your environment and security requirements, you might need to adjust paths, handle authentication more securely (e.g., storing tokens), and ensure the script is executed with appropriate permissions.
